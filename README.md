Welcome to the **most unnecessarily elegant** YouTube downloader you've ever seen... built with **Tkinter**, **yt-dlp**, and **emotional damage** from buffering videos in 2023.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Download YouTube Videos or Shorts**  
  Because YouTube is full of genius... and also cats playing piano.

- ✅ **Select Your Preferred Quality**  
  From crisp **1080p** down to **Audio Only** for those times you just want the *vibes* without the *visuals*.

- ✅ **Professional Progress Bar**  
  We ditched the status messages. You get a smooth progress bar. It looks legit. Like it’s doing things.

- ✅ **No Cloud. No Logs. Just You.**  
  No creepy tracking, no weird ads, no sending your video URLs to aliens. Your downloads stay YOURS.

- ✅ **Tooltips That Explain Things Nicely**  
  Because buttons without explanations are just anxiety in rectangular form.

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```
